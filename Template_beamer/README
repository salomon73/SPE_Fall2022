# LaTeX beamer template for SPC presentations
This package provides a LaTeX beamer template for SPC presentations. It is based on the official
EPFL Power Point template and implements the EPFL rules about the usage of the new visual identity
(the only exception is the red rectangle in which lies the presentation title).

## How to use it
### Without installation
If you want to use it without installing it first, you will need to copy the `.sty` files and the
`figures` folder into your presentation folder. Then, simply add the following line into your
presentation preamble:
> \usetheme{spc}

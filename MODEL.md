[Semi empirical theory] (Chap. 4 - 4.2 Particle Induced Electron Emission II - Hasselkamp)

> Only normal incidence ion impact considered
> For other impact angles : yield prop to sec(Theta) 
> Isotropic disttribution of excited electrons in the solid
> Planar surface barrier 

>> Result: Cosine angular distribution outside the solid

> Gamma = (PL)/(2J)(dE/dx)e
  with 
	- J: mean energy to produce free electron inside the solid
	- dE/dx: energy loss (all processes taken into account) of a penetrating ion to electrons inside the solid\
	- P: probability for an electron to penetrate the surface barrier (From inside to outside the solid) - P = P(E) 

> Stopping power from Bethe and Firsov theories
	> Gamma prop to sqrt(E) for E < max dE/dx
	> Gamma prop to  1/E log(E) for E > max dE/dx
